        <p>Although racial equality is now seen as some left-wing political correctness in American society, overt or covert racial discrimination has still not been reduced a lot. Reversely, following the right-wing Donald J. Trump’s re-election assisted by the white populist tide, such a situation may become a bigger problem in the next three or five years. The government and society may make larger-scale and more systematic discriminations based on ethnicities on some specific ethnic minority groups.</p>
        <br />
        <p>This project was designed to be a resource that guides readers step-by-step in understanding and analyzing the civil rights of minority groups, from African Americans to Asian and Latino communities. I created this guide so that readers can learn the process of researching a topic closely related to ethnic minority groups and their social status. As members living in the United States, no one can ignore this social problem, especially when you are one individual among these minority groups.</p>
        <br />
        <p>Writing this guide as a digital guide, or resource, had its own challenges. Translating complex historical and social issues into the guide took filter-like selection and organization of content. One of the biggest challenges was presenting the information in a way that was both thorough and engaging without overwhelming the reader. I needed to balance the depth and clarity, especially when telling the readers how to find useful resources. </p>
        <br />
        <p>Throughout this development process, rhetorically, I learned how to adapt a scholarly approach into a more accessible format while maintaining somewhat academic rigor. I also became more familiar with digital tools and resources for academic research, such as archives and online databases, in the process of writing the guide. </p>
        <br />
        <p>When creating my original asset, a “how-to” tutorial, I reduced my topic covered from a comprehensive research process to some simple source selection steps. The process of deciding what to write and what to get rid of made the guide more readable and clear in content. </p>
        <br />
        <p>I selected the Creative Commons BY-NC 4.0 license to ensure that this guide remains freely accessible for educational and non-commercial use while protecting the integrity of the content. Others can share, use, or even adapt and improve the guide based on current, but they cannot use it commercially. I believe this approach preserves the guide’s original message and academic rigor. </p>
