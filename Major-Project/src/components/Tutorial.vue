        <h1 class="green">So...How To Start A Research?</h1>
        <p>It’s not hard to begin researching ethnic minority group rights in U.S. society. We can divide our research into several parts. </p>
        <br />
        <p>Let’s start with what you want to do, or, which academic area you want your research to be on. Take the topic discussed here as an example, you can first choose which ethnic minority group you want to focus on. Do not just limit the vision to groups such as African Americans and Native Americans, the immigrants that have continuously migrated to the U.S. throughout the past few hundred years can also be worth researching. Asian Americans, Jews, and Hispanos are the most significant groups. And among these groups, we can even get more detailed divisions such as Chinese Americans, Japanese Americans, Vietnamese Americans, Indian Americans, etc. Even those who were but are no longer, such as Irish Immigrant Americans and Italian Immigrant Americans in the 19th and 20th centuries can be researched. In this example, I am going to take East Asian Americans’ civil rights and social status as a whole as the research focus.</p>
        <br />
        <p>A very essential part of research is to read materials widely. This will help efficiently get inspiration for ideas and sources that can be referred to. You will want to start from a relatively general page that will lead to other different and more detailed materials. Wikipedia is a good starting point, as it provides a comprehensive description of the history and current situation of the area you are going to research. For example, I just need to google “Asian American Wikipedia” or “Asian American rights Wikipedia”, and relative pages will show in the results. You may use your language to search for the page, but English Wikipedia is the most comprehensive and most content-rich. </p>
        <br />
        <p>The “Asian Americans” Wikipedia page[14] is divided into multiple parts, and we need to find the parts that are the most useful to us. It is like how a filter works, we filter the terminology section and look for the parts we are interested in and those really matter to our research. Among these sections, I think the history section is the most important one when researching minority groups, and their past of racial discrimination should not be ignored or forgotten. So we switch to the “Exclusive Era” in the History section, and we find that the “restrictive legislation” interests me. We then further go into the Chinese Exclusion Act page to research the history of Asian Americans, specifically Chinese immigrants, being excluded and discriminated against in federal legal aspects. Similarly, we can also learn and refer to the history of the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II and federal cases such as United States v. Wong Kim Ark (1898). We can also go over other important sections such as “Social and political issues” and go through them to learn what happened to Asian Americans’ social status in the past and now.</p>
        <br />
        <p>However, Wikipedia cannot serve as a very scholarly reliable source. Since it is open and editable to everyone, there can be misleading and biased edits and texts. I prefer to use it more like a navigation that tells you which ways you can go, and for the next step you go yourselves in specific paths researching more detailed things. The archives, such as the National Archives I have introduced above a reliable and widely covered archive that provides a large amount of sources. Very clearly, exclusion is a very hot topic in the archive. We can click on the “Enforcing Immigration and Exclusion” topic and take a look at the systematic exclusion of Asian Americans (and Pacific Islanders) from the 1870s to the 1950s.[15] </p>
        <br />
        <p>From here, we can look at the detailed transcripts of the bills such as the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882.[16] The National Archives provides the transcript and an electrical copy of the original manuscript. Similarly, we can search for blogs and articles that can support our arguments and research. The article “Bringing the Past to Light through the Chinese Exclusion Act Case File” by Ddancis posted in Asian Pacific American Heritage[17] gives an analysis and the history of Chinese immigrants being excluded. Such an article gives real materials and experiences to describe what happened during that time. When writing a paper, we can cite and refer to these materials and articles to support our arguments.</p>
        <br />
        <p>Scholarly papers are also important and reliable to use when writing papers. We can find all kinds of papers on platforms such as Academic Search Complete[18] if your university supports this service. Google Scholar is also a useful tool that covers a wide range of papers, and it directs you to the sources where you can read some of the papers for free. Entering the EBSCOhost, we can search what we want using key words or phrases. Smartly using filters such as “Full Text” and “Peer Reviewed” can improve the overall quality of your research results. If you have not come out with an idea of what keywords you want to do, it provides you with databases to choose, from based on topics.</p>
        <br />
        <p>For example, we type in the keywords “Asian American discrimination” which is closely related to our topic. You do not need to really type in some very specific keywords for what you want – some general keywords are also good for this search engine. Now we choose the article “‘China Virus’ and ‘Kung-Flu’: A Critical Race Case Study of Asian American Journalists' Experiences During COVID-19.” by Denetra Walker and Allison Daniel Anders.[19] Published in 2022, this paper focuses on racial discrimination towards Asian Americans during COVID-19. Such articles are very helpful sources for our research. Specifically in this article, the authors provided examples and data of Asian Americans being targets of hate crimes during the epidemic. They also tried to analyze this inequality both from social, press (journalism) and historical aspects. </p>
        <br />
        <p>Besides texts and pictures, statistics are direct and clear as well. According to the U.S. Department of Justice statistics, 52.5% of hate crime incidents in 2023 are based upon “Race/Ethnicity/Ancestry”. A report on “Racial Discrimination in Contemporary America” on the White House website also provides wide statistics of racial bias and discrimination in all aspects of society based on different categories.[20] Providing such data in papers can greatly improve the reliability of the article and make the current situation of Asian Americans – in this example – clear and readable to the readers.</p>
