        Welcome to the research community focusing on minority group civil rights 
        in U.S. society! This digital research website will introduce you the 
        different resources, ideas, and a tutorial on this attractive research topic. 
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        This guide is based on my own experience with this topic in previous research. 
        In my previous two research, I focused on the civil rights movement and the 
        black powers movement. Both movements were milestones in the history of black 
        people in the U.S., which gave them civil rights and helped them establish a 
        collective self-identity as an ethnic minority group.

        As a result, this website will be a guide or tutorial-oriented resource for 
        the research community of those who are interested in researching American 
        minority groups. It is not enough to only focus on black people nowadays. 
        After hundreds of years of migration, the diversity of American ethnicities 
        has been up to a height that it has never been. East Asians, Mideast people, 
        Indians, and Hispanos, have become more and more significant powers that cannot 
        be ignored in American society.

        However, even 160 years after the Civil War, 60 years after the civil rights movement, 
        racism and discrimination still widely exist here in the U.S. People are still often 
        discriminated against or abused only because of their ethnicity. Violence is still one 
        of the largest problems here. White supremacy, extended to ethnic supremacy, still exists 
        and is hard to get rid of from society due to its deep historical roots in this nation. 
        This can be observed from the social incidents and political events during these years. 
        Black people, the second largest ethnic group in the U.S., are the most likely to die 
        due to police violence.[1] They have far higher data recorded as a ratio to be killed 
        than other ethnicities. Among all hate crimes in the U.S., which reached a new peak in 
        2023, 52% percent were due to race and ethnicity.[2][3][4]

        Ethnicity minority groups have already broken some of the chains from a general and law 
        aspect in the society, and now it is a huge topic to practice them in actions. This is 
        what this tutorial wants to do â€“ research the past and current situation, giving advice 
        for a better future of ethnic equity in the melting pot of U.S. society.
